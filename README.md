# scaleXplorer

This app calculates all the original scales of the mode of a scale. For example, if you have the C modes, the output will be:

Scale	C D E F G A B C	is mode	1	of	C D E F G A B C\n
Scale	C D Eb F G A Bb C	is mode	2	of	Bb C D Eb F G A Bb\n
Scale	C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C	is mode	3	of	Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab\n
Scale	C D E F# G A B C	is mode	4	of	G A B C D E F# G\n
Scale	C D E F G A Bb C	is mode	5	of	F G A Bb C D E F\n
Scale	C D Eb F G Ab Bb C	is mode	6	of	Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb\n
Scale	C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C	is mode	7	of	Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C Db\n
